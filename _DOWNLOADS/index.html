<p>Universal Access to All Knowledge has been the dream for millennia, from the Library of Alexandria on forward. The idea is that if you&#8217;re curious enough to want to know something, that you can get access to that information. That was the promise of the printing press or Andrew Carnegie&#8217;s public libraries &#8212; fueling so much citizenship and democracy in the United States. The Internet was the opportunity to really make this dream come true.</p>



<p>What we have is an opportunity that happens maybe only once a millennium. The opportunity that&nbsp; comes only when we change how knowledge is recorded and shared. From oral to manuscript, manuscript to printing, and now from printing to digital. I was lucky enough to be there in 1980 and thought: <em>what a fantastic opportunity to try to influence that transition.</em></p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft size-full is-resized"><a href="http://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Memex.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Memex.png" alt="" class="wp-image-23561" width="429" height="384" srcset="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Memex.png 627w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Memex-300x269.png 300w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Memex-624x559.png 624w" sizes="(max-width: 429px) 100vw, 429px" /></a><figcaption>From&nbsp;<em><a href="https://books.google.ru/books?id=uUkEAAAAMBAJ">Life</a></em>&nbsp;magazine, Volume 19, Number 11, Sept 10, 1945</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Of course, we were building on the vision of many before us. This dream of having an interlocking publishing system had been around for a long time. Vannevar Bush’s 1945 article “As We May Think” was very much on people&#8217;s minds in the 1980s. There was Ted Nelson’s Xanadu—a world of hypertext. Doug Engelbart’s way of annotating and enabling you to build on the works of others.</p>



<p>The key thing was not the computers. Actually, it was the network. It was the ability to communicate with each other. Sure, anybody could go and write word processing documents. That&#8217;s good. But can you make everybody a publisher? Can everyone find their voice and their community no matter where they are in the world? And can people write in a way that allows others to build on their work? By 1996, we had built that. It was the World Wide Web.</p>



<p>With this global publishing network, the Web, we could finally build the library. It was <em>time</em> to build the library. In 1996, I thought: <em>Why don&#8217;t we just build this thing? I mean, how hard could it be? Sure, maybe we&#8217;re going to have to go and digitize a whole library, but that couldn&#8217;t be that hard, right?</em></p>



<p>And so, a group of us said, let&#8217;s do this. We started by archiving the most transient of media, which was the World Wide Web’s pages. We did that for five years before we even made the Wayback Machine. The idea was to record what people were publishing and be able to go and use that in new and different ways. Could we build a library to preserve all of that material, but then add computers to the mix, so that something new and magic happens?&nbsp; Could we connect people, connect ideas, build on each other&#8217;s concepts with computers and these new AI things that we knew were coming. Ultimately could we make the world smarter?</p>



<p>Could we make people smarter by being better connected? Not just because they could read what other people were writing, but because machines would help filter information, scan vast amounts of knowledge, emphasize what is most important, provide context to the deluge.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft size-large is-resized"><a href="http://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/2016-1-scaled.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/2016-1-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-23565" width="387" height="257" srcset="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/2016-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/2016-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/2016-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/2016-1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/2016-1-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/2016-1-624x416.jpg 624w" sizes="(max-width: 387px) 100vw, 387px" /></a></figure></div>



<p>In many ways, we have achieved this, but not completely enough: now people are writing and sharing knowledge, but it is intermingled with misinformation &#8212; purposefully false information.&nbsp; We still don&#8217;t have the tools to filter out the lies, and in many ways, we have business models that prosper when misinformation is widely shared. So while the dream of access may be at hand, we lack the tools and responsible organizations to help us make good use of the flood of data now at our fingertips. Given how new our digital transition is, this may not be that surprising, but it is an urgent issue that faces us.&nbsp;We need to fight misinformation and build data-mining tools to leverage all this knowledge to help people make better decisions &#8212; to be smarter.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is our challenge for our next 25 years.</p>



<p>When we started the Internet Archive, I felt this project needed to be done in the open and as a non-profit. We needed to have not just one or two search engines, we needed lots and lots of different organizations building their new ideas on top of the whole knowledge base of humanity. We could help by being a library for this new digital world.</p>

<p>The libraries I grew up with were vast and free, and came with librarians who helped me understand and find things I needed to know.&nbsp; In our new digital world, that future is not guaranteed. It may be that most people will just feed on what they can access for free, placed there because it&#8217;s promoted by somebody. If we don&#8217;t solve this&#8211;getting quality published material to the internet population&#8211;we&#8217;re going to bring up a generation educated on whatever dreck they can find online. So we have to build not only universal access to lots of webpages, but access to the right and best information&#8211; Universal Access to All Knowledge. That is going to require requiring changes to existing&nbsp; business models and adjustments by long standing institutions. We need an Internet with many winners. If we have an Internet with just a few winners, some big corporations and large governments that are controlling too much of what’s online, then we will all lose.</p>



<p>A library alone can not solve all of these issues, but it is a necessary component, needed infrastructure in a digital world.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><a href="http://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/October-26-2012-1.jpg"><img loading="lazy" width="800" height="534" src="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/October-26-2012-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-23563" srcset="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/October-26-2012-1.jpg 800w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/October-26-2012-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/October-26-2012-1-768x513.jpg 768w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/October-26-2012-1-624x417.jpg 624w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a><figcaption>On October 12, 2012, the Internet Archive reached 10 petabytes of data stored in its repository.</figcaption></figure>



<p>25 years ago, I thought building this new library would largely be a technological process, but I was wrong.&nbsp; It turns out that it&#8217;s mostly a people process. Crucially, the Internet Archive has been supported by hundreds of organizations. About 800 libraries have helped build the web collections that are in the Wayback Machine. Over 1000 libraries have contributed books to be digitized into the collections—now 5 million volumes strong. And beyond that, people with expertise in, say, railway timetables, Old Time Radio, 78 RPM records—they’ve been donating physical media and uploading digital files to our servers that you see here in this room. Last year, well over 100 million people used the resources of the Internet Archive, and over 100,000 people made a financial donation to support us.&nbsp; This has truly been a global project&#8211; the people’s library.</p>



<p>I love the weird and wacky stuff of the Internet, just the fun and frolicy things. You go online and see these things like, wow, that&#8217;s remarkable.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><a href="http://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Buddy-Clark-Collection.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Buddy-Clark-Collection-1024x731.png" alt="" class="wp-image-23568" width="430" height="307" srcset="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Buddy-Clark-Collection-1024x731.png 1024w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Buddy-Clark-Collection-300x214.png 300w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Buddy-Clark-Collection-768x548.png 768w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Buddy-Clark-Collection-1536x1097.png 1536w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Buddy-Clark-Collection-624x446.png 624w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Buddy-Clark-Collection.png 1882w" sizes="(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px" /></a></figure></div>



<p>Yesterday, I was looking through the uploads from Kevin Hubler.&nbsp;He donated the collection his father built over his lifetime.&nbsp; His father collected everything a particular singer, Buddy Clark, had ever done.&nbsp;Clark was a 1940’s big band singer who died when he was 37. &nbsp;So I could listen to records, see sheet music, and dive into details, all thanks to Kevin Hubler.&nbsp; I love this&#8211; going down rabbit holes and learning something deeply.&nbsp; This was a tribute to Buddy Clark, but also to Kevin and his father&#8211; who prepared and preserved something they loved for the future.</p>



<p>That we&#8217;re able to enjoy each other and to express our wackiness&#8211; that&#8217;s the win of the World Wide Web!&nbsp; That&#8217;s the thing that you wouldn&#8217;t get if it were all just more channels of television.&nbsp; Yes, the internet and the World Wide Web are a bit of the Wild West, but would you want it any other way?&nbsp; Isn&#8217;t that where the fun and interesting things come from?</p>



<p>Today, it is still the people&#8217;s internet. That&#8217;s the internet that I wanted to support by starting the Internet Archive. The World Wide Web is an experiment in radical sharing where people feel that they&#8217;re better off, not worse off, building on other people&#8217;s works.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I’m hopeful and optimistic that we can build this next 25 years to be as interesting and fun as the last. That we can usher in another level of technology, another 25 years of blossoming, interesting ideas.</p>

<p>I want to&nbsp; end this talk with a personal story&#8211; my grandfather Douglas Lurton was a publisher and an author who died before I was born. Last weekend I searched for his name using full text search in the 20 million texts now on the Archive and found this quotation from him in a newspaper from West Sacramento: &#8220;Take the tools in hand and carve your own best life.&#8221; &#8212; <a href="https://archive.org/details/cawsahs_000518/page/7/mode/1up?q=%22Take+the+tools+in+hand+and+carve+your+own+best+life%22">Douglas Lurton</a></p>



<p>Now, I would like to extend my grandfather’s advice.&nbsp; “Let us all&nbsp; take our tools in hand, and together, carve our own best future.”</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s keep the trust.</p>

<p>As part of the Internet Archive’s 25th Anniversary celebration we asked artist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTurbo_Avedon">LaTurbo Avedon</a> to contemplate what the year 2046 and the future of the internet might look like through the lens of their own art practice.</p>



<p>LaTurbo Avedon introduces the work <em>Hypertext Wishes</em>, inviting viewers to follow a virtual token as it passes into a contemplative well of the Internet. Avedon has spent the past decade developing a body of work that illuminates the ever-growing intensity between users and virtual experiences, pursuing creative environments that deepen the meaning of memories found in the metaverse. They curate and design Panther Modern, a file-based exhibition space that encourages artists to create site-specific installations for the Internet.</p>



<p>Here is a clip from <em>Hypertext Wishes</em>, available for viewing at Internet Archive Headquarters:</p>





<p>The imagery from Hypertext Wishes is made available on the Internet Archive here:&nbsp;<a href="https://archive.org/details/15_20211020_20211020_1907">https://archive.org/details/15_20211020_20211020_1907</a></p>



<p><strong>LaTurbo Avedon</strong> is an avatar and artist, creating work that emphasizes the practice of non-physical identity and authorship. Their process of character creation continues through gaming, performance and exhibitions. Their work has appeared internationally, including&nbsp; The Whitney Museum (New York City). The Manchester International Festival (UK), Transmediale (Berlin), Haus der elektronischen Künste (Basel), HMVK (Dortmund), Barbican Center (London), Galeries Lafayette (Paris), and TRANSFER Gallery (New York).</p>

<p>Kanta Kapoor was the first in her family to go to a university. Growing up in New Delhi, she was determined to become an independent woman, and she knew education was the key to success.</p>



<p>“I understand the value of knowledge—to survive in this world, to make a living and make informed decisions,” said Kapoor, who excelled in school and worked at public and university libraries in India for several years before moving to Canada in 2012.</p>



<iframe loading="lazy" src="https://archive.org/embed/kanta-kapoor-hero-award-2021" width="640" height="480" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>



<p>Kapoor developed an expertise in emerging technologies and became an advocate for open sharing of information. Now, she is manager of support services at the Milton Public Library (MPL) in Ontario. In that role, she helped MPL become an early adopter of the Internet Archive’s Open Libraries program, which offers digital access to the physical books that a library owns through the library practice known as controlled digital lending (CDL).</p>



<p>For her efforts to broaden access and embrace innovative practices, Kapoor has been named a recipient of the 2021 Internet Archive Hero Award. The annual award recognizes those who have exhibited leadership in making information available for digital learners all over the world. Past recipients have included<a href="https://blog.archive.org/2020/10/20/michelle-wu-receives-internet-archive-hero-award-for-establishing-the-legal-basis-for-controlled-digital-lending/"> Michelle Wu</a>, <a href="https://blog.archive.org/2019/10/23/unlocking-the-potential-for-every-high-school-library-2019-internet-archive-hero-award/">Phillips Academy</a>, the <a href="https://blog.biodiversitylibrary.org/2015/11/bhl-receives-internet-archives-internet.html">Biodiversity Heritage Library</a>, and the <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/grateful-dead-win-internet-hero-award-for-viral-marketing/">Grateful Dead.</a></p>

<p>In her career, Kapoor has focused on leveraging technology to improve services to the community. She has a master’s degree in library science and gained a specialty in open-source software and data management through additional graduate studies at the University of Toronto.</p>



<p>Kapoor said she was drawn to MPL in 2019 because the leadership team was forward thinking and there was an opportunity to expand community-led projects.</p>



<p>“We were challenged to think outside of the box and become champions throughout Canadian public libraries to stay ahead of the curve,” Kapoor said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>&#8220;In my career, I’ve seen many changes—and it’s still evolving. We need to continue to adapt and embrace new technology.&#8221;</p><cite>Kanta Kapoor, 2021 Internet Archive Hero Award recipient</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>In her newly created position, she helped improve services for patrons and library staff alike with new technology, mobile apps and digitization of materials. When she was introduced to the Open Libraries program, Kapoor said she was impressed by the ability to provide millions of digitized books to users across the world. MPL decided this was the direction it wanted to go and became one of the first public libraries in Canada to embrace CDL and embed a link to Open Libraries in its catalogue.</p>



<p>MPL’s Mark Williams, chief librarian and chief executive officer, credits Kapoor’s strong leadership skills in building the partnership with the Internet Archive, which helped the MPL community during the earliest days of COVID-19 closures.</p>



<p>“It meant we were able to provide our patrons with access to tens of thousands of digitized materials at a time when they were more welcome than ever, during the pandemic lockdowns, while also being able to donate over 40,000 items for the benefit of a truly global audience,” he said. “We are incredibly fortunate that Kanta is part of the MPL team and her&nbsp; compassion, graciousness, humility and ultimately exemplary leadership have been put to good use.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="http://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/MPL-Main-Outside-Oct-2014-004_3mb-scaled.jpg"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/MPL-Main-Outside-Oct-2014-004_3mb-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-23505" srcset="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/MPL-Main-Outside-Oct-2014-004_3mb-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/MPL-Main-Outside-Oct-2014-004_3mb-300x200.jpg 300w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/MPL-Main-Outside-Oct-2014-004_3mb-768x512.jpg 768w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/MPL-Main-Outside-Oct-2014-004_3mb-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/MPL-Main-Outside-Oct-2014-004_3mb-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/MPL-Main-Outside-Oct-2014-004_3mb-624x416.jpg 624w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><figcaption><em>Milton Public Library, Milton, Ontario</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>MPL expanded its partnership by donating physical items to the Archive, obtained a state-of-the-art digitization scanner, and became involved with<a href="https://www.libraryfutures.net/"> Library Futures</a>, a coalition of libraries and other stakeholders championing equitable access to knowledge.</p>



<p>Kapoor has helped promote materials available through CDL on the library’s web page, newsletters, and social media. So far, the response by users has been positive and Kapoor is reaching across her professional networks to educate her colleagues about the potential benefits.</p>



<p>“I encourage my fellow librarians to participate in this wonderful project to help their communities out,” Kapoor said. “In my career, I’ve seen many changes—and it’s still evolving. We need to continue to adapt and embrace new technology. I would like to see more libraries joining hands together to serve the community.”</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="http://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Lisa-Weaver_Headshot_.jpg"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="682" src="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Lisa-Weaver_Headshot_-1024x682.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-23508" srcset="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Lisa-Weaver_Headshot_-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Lisa-Weaver_Headshot_-300x200.jpg 300w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Lisa-Weaver_Headshot_-768x511.jpg 768w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Lisa-Weaver_Headshot_-624x415.jpg 624w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Lisa-Weaver_Headshot_.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><figcaption><em>Lisa Radha Weaver, director of collections and program development, Hamilton Public Library, Hamilton, Ontario.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>As a child, Lisa Radha Weaver says she spent most Sunday afternoons at the Kitchener Public Library in Ontario. She has fond memories of the friendly library staff helping her load up as many books as she could carry home.</p>



<p>Then, as a college student at Trent and Queen’s Universities, Weaver again was struck by how kind and generous the people were behind the reference desk at the library. Finally, she asked: How do you get this job?</p>



<iframe loading="lazy" src="https://archive.org/embed/lisa-radha-weaver-hero-award-2021" width="640" height="480" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>



<p>Weaver learned about the pathway to become a professional librarian. So, after finishing her undergraduate degree in education, she earned her master of library and information science at Western University in London, Ontario.</p>



<p>“I knew that I wanted to serve the public in the same way that I had always been served at all the libraries that I had the privilege of growing up with in the first half of my life,” said Weaver, now director of collections and program development at Hamilton Public Library (HPL) in Ontario.</p>



<p>But that public service role was tested in the spring of 2020 when HPL closed due to COVID-19, as she and her fellow library staff were left wondering how they were going to get books to members who were now locked out of their physical collection. Weaver had been instrumental in helping HPL become an early adopter of the Internet Archive’s Open Libraries program, which offers digital access to the physical books that a library owns. Because of the collections team&#8217;s hard work, HPL patrons had access to tens of thousands of books from the safety of their homes, and could continue to read and learn while the physical library remained closed.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><a href="http://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Lisa-Weaver-HPL-and-Connie-Vissers-Oct-28_Super_Portrait.jpg"><img loading="lazy" width="744" height="446" src="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Lisa-Weaver-HPL-and-Connie-Vissers-Oct-28_Super_Portrait.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-23512" srcset="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Lisa-Weaver-HPL-and-Connie-Vissers-Oct-28_Super_Portrait.jpg 744w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Lisa-Weaver-HPL-and-Connie-Vissers-Oct-28_Super_Portrait-300x180.jpg 300w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Lisa-Weaver-HPL-and-Connie-Vissers-Oct-28_Super_Portrait-624x374.jpg 624w" sizes="(max-width: 744px) 100vw, 744px" /></a><figcaption><em>Lisa Radha Weaver presents Hamilton Public Library&#8217;s&nbsp;1-Millionth eBook user, Connie Vissers, with a special HPL tote bag prize on October 28, 2020 at the Terryberry Branch.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>In recognition of her contributions in her 20-plus year career, and her foresight in leading HPL into new digital lending practices, Weaver has been named the recipient of the 2021 Internet Archive Hero Award. The annual award recognizes those who have exhibited leadership in making information available for digital learners all over the world. Past recipients have included<a href="https://blog.archive.org/2020/10/20/michelle-wu-receives-internet-archive-hero-award-for-establishing-the-legal-basis-for-controlled-digital-lending/"> Michelle Wu</a>, <a href="https://blog.archive.org/2019/10/23/unlocking-the-potential-for-every-high-school-library-2019-internet-archive-hero-award/">Phillips Academy</a>, the <a href="https://blog.biodiversitylibrary.org/2015/11/bhl-receives-internet-archives-internet.html">Biodiversity Heritage Library</a>, and the <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/grateful-dead-win-internet-hero-award-for-viral-marketing/">Grateful Dead</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Weaver has long been committed to broadening access to information. Not everyone is as lucky as she was to have an adult bring them to the library, she says. Others don’t live nearby or work hours that limit their ability to physically visit a branch. To serve the changing needs of users, she has embraced digitizing collections and innovative outreach.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Weaver led efforts at HPL to become an early adopter of Controlled Digital Lending, as well as identify<a href="https://blog.archive.org/2021/05/26/behind-the-curtain-of-the-hamilton-public-library-theater-book-donation/"> special collections to donate</a> to the Internet Archives for digitization.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“CDL means removing barriers to access to collections in a way that is sustainable, accessible and equitable. With one library card, users have access to THE library, not just your local branch, system, region, province, state or even country,” Weaver said. “CDL means great breadth and depth in collections access. No one library can have all the books. CDL helps all libraries work together to best support each member to find what they are looking for, when and where they are looking for it.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>&#8220;I just really believe the library should be there for everyone, where they are and when they need it.&#8221;</p><cite>Lisa Radha Weaver, 2021 Internet Archive Hero Award Recipient</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>The timing of HPL’s embrace of CDL in the fall of 2019 was fortuitous. When the physical buildings had to close due to the pandemic in March 2020 for three months, the library was positioned to provide users with digital access to its collection through the Internet Archive.</p>



<p>“Our hearts were a little bit less heavy, knowing that at least that part of our collection continued to be accessible to people,” Weaver said. “We had positive feedback.”</p>



<p>HPL also beefed up its own virtual library collection and created a range of online programming. Weaver says it developed an online reference system so users could call, email or chat to get connected to the resources or collections, which was especially helpful to teachers and students. Staff also phoned older members of the library to just check in and some were thankful to learn about new ways to access the library online.</p>



<p>Weaver says her team at the library is fearless and collaborative in how they approach their work.</p>



<p>She credits support from her administration and green light from the library’s legal team with the success of the CDL at Hamilton. Management promotes the notion of a “freedom to fail card” to encourage risk-taking, which says she seized upon to embark on the practice. Also, the library got a legal option that it shared widely backing up the notion that it was well within the library’s right to participate. “Those two things really allowed us to step forward confidently with the Internet Archive in this project,” Weaver said.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><a href="http://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Central-Library.jpg"><img loading="lazy" width="796" height="401" src="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Central-Library.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-23510" srcset="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Central-Library.jpg 796w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Central-Library-300x151.jpg 300w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Central-Library-768x387.jpg 768w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Central-Library-624x314.jpg 624w" sizes="(max-width: 796px) 100vw, 796px" /></a><figcaption><em>Hamilton Public Library, Hamilton, Ontario.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Since 2019, Weaver has joined the call for wider acceptance of CDL. She has participated in several panel presentations with librarians to explain the details of CDL. She has also lobbied with others in Washington, D.C., making the case to lawmakers on Capitol Hill for policy that supports the practice. Weaver is known for her professionalism and thoughtfulness in promoting the benefit of CDL.</p>



<p>“The ‘c’ in CDL is controlled. One copy, one use,” Weaver said. “We already own these books. Why did we buy these books, if not, for the broader library community to access?&nbsp; None of us are closing our libraries because we are running out of books, so doesn’t it make sense to share? Most people buy into that idea.”</p>



<p>Before joining HPL in 2018, Weaver was with the Toronto District School Board as manager of collections and extension services for 13 years. In that role, she coordinated operations with the largest library system in Canada and worked with diverse communities to expand digital access to learning materials for students. Weaver was honored by the Ontario School Library Association with the 2006 Mover and Shaker Award and the 2016 Award for Technical Service.</p>



<p>The motivation in all her work is simple: “I just really believe the library should be there for everyone, where they are and when they need it.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>As part of the Internet Archive’s 25th Anniversary celebration we asked artist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olia_Lialina">Olia Lialina</a> to contemplate what the year 2046 and the future of the internet might look like through the lens of her own art practice.</p>



<p>Olia Lialina&#8217;s artwork <em>Perpetual Calendar</em> builds upon the rich digital folklore tradition to start a day on your social network by wishing each other a good one in the form of an image, often animated, and most likely glittering. With <a href="https://haveagood.today/">https://haveagood.today/</a> you can go to the future and the past, checking what day of the week were you born, or on what day of the week New Year eve 2071 is going to be. At the same time you can see it as a flipping through of her archived collection of the graphics that represent an important layer of <a href="http://art.teleportacia.org/observation/vernacular/">vernacular web</a>. In the beginning of the century the tradition to wish a good (nice, great, sexy,&#8230;) Monday (Tuesday, Humpday,&#8230;) with a self made or found graphic replaced &#8220;Welcome to My Home Page&#8221; greetings and relieved the ever growing urge for updates.</p>

<p><strong>Olia Lialina</strong> (b. 1971, Moscow) is among the best-known participants in the net.art scene of the 1990s – an early-days, network-based art pioneer. Her early work had a great impact on recognizing the Internet as a medium for artistic expression and storytelling. This century, her continuous and close attention to Internet architecture, ‘net.language’ and Web vernacular – in both artistic and publishing projects – has made her an important voice in contemporary art and new media theory. Lialina is a co-author of Digital Folklore Reader and keeper of One Terabyte of Kilobyte Age archive (together with Dragan ESpenschied). She is an Animated GIF model and professor for Art and Design Online at Merz Akademie in Stuttgart, Germany.</p>

<p><em>The September 2021 DWeb Meetup explored the potential and reality of decentralized storage with two projects leading the way toward storing highly valuable cultural data at scale.</em></p>



<p><em style="user-select: auto;">Watch the recording of the event and learn more about the speakers below. </em></p>



<iframe loading="lazy" src="https://archive.org/embed/dweb-meetup-september-2021-decentralized-storage-preserving-humanitys-greatest-assets" width="640" height="480" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allowfullscreen></iframe>



<p>The September 2021 DWeb meetup was held virtually on Tuesday, September 28, 2021 at 10am PT, optimized for American/European time zones. Wendy Hanamura welcomed attendees and kicked off the meetup. Brewster Kahle, the founder of the Internet Archive, set the stage for the discussion by emphasising the need for a more secure and decentralized web. The Meetup also broached the possibility of a DWeb camp in the Fall of 2022.</p>



<p>The discussion explained the differences between the IPFS and Filecoin systems, how they work together and delved into the two projects led by Arkadiy Kukarkin and Jonathan Dotan which are at the cutting edge of storing large scale data of high cultural significance in the Filecoin network. They discussed the challenges, successes, and future opportunities presented by these efforts.</p>



<p>Lastly, attendees welcomed Eseohe “Ese” Ojo, the new DWeb Projects Organizer and said farewell to Mai Ishikawa Sutton as she goes off to grad school in Japan. Mai will continue to stay connected with the DWeb community and can be reached on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/maira">@maira</a>. Ese can be reached at <a href="mailto:dweb@archive.org">dweb@archive.org</a> or on Twitter <a href="http://twitter.com/eseoheojo">@EseoheOjo</a>. The meetup wrapped up with socializing and networking in Gather.town.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The next DWeb Meetup <strong>“DWeb Meetup Nov 2021 &#8211; Centering Respect, Trust and Equity in the DWeb”</strong> is scheduled for Thursday, November 4, 2021 at 5pm PT, optimized for Asia time zones. At this meetup, we will hear the latest in the DWeb and from our featured speaker Coraline Ada Ehmke on centering respect, trust, and equity in the DWeb. You can read Coraline’s blog post on the DWeb principle of Mutual Respect <a href="https://blog.archive.org/2021/09/03/the-sacred-geometry-of-respect-trust-and-equity/">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We’re interested in hearing from DWeb projects about the breakthroughs, challenges, and new roadmaps they might be exploring. For anyone interested in participating in lightning rounds at this meetup, let us know <a href="https://form.jotform.com/203236908715154">here</a>.</p>

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft size-medium is-resized"><a href="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/scholar-vaporwave-logo.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/scholar-vaporwave-logo-300x145.png" alt="" class="wp-image-23519" width="225" height="109" srcset="https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/scholar-vaporwave-logo-300x145.png 300w, https://blog.archive.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/scholar-vaporwave-logo.png 467w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /></a></figure></div>



<p>As part of our ongoing efforts to archive and provide perpetual access to at-risk, open-access scholarship, we have released Refcat (“reference” + “catalog”), the citation index culled from the catalog that underpins our <a href="https://scholar.archive.org/">IA Scholar</a> service for discovering the scholarly literature and research outputs within Internet Archive. This first release of the Refcat dataset contains over 1.3 billion citations extracted from over 60 million metadata records and over 120 million scholarly artifacts (articles, books, datasets, proceedings, code, etc) that IA Scholar has archived through web harvesting, digitization, integrations with other open knowledge services, and through partnerships and joint initiatives.</p>



<p>Refcat represents one of the larger citation graph datasets of scholarly literature, as well as uniquely containing a notable portion of citations from works that do not have a DOI or persistent identifier. We hope this dataset will be a valuable community resource alongside other critical knowledge graph projects, including those with which we are collaborating, such as <a href="https://opencitations.net/">OpenCitations</a> and <a href="http://wikicite.org/">Wikicite</a>. </p>



<p>The Refcat dataset is released under a CC0 license and is <a href="https://archive.org/details/refcat_2021-07-28">available for download from archive.org</a>. The related software created for the extraction and matching process, including exact and fuzzy citation matching (<a href="https://gitlab.com/internetarchive/refcat">refcat</a> and <a href="https://gitlab.com/internetarchive/fuzzycat/">fuzzycat</a>), are also released as open-source tools. For those interested in technical details about the project, a white paper is <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.06595">available on arxiv.org</a> authored by IA engineers, including Martin Czygan, who led work on Refcat, and is described in <a href="https://guide.fatcat.wiki/reference_graph.html">our catalog user guide</a>.</p>



<p>What does Refcat mean for regular users of IA Scholar? Refcat results from work to ensure the interconnection between material within IA Scholar and other resources archived in Internet Archive in order to make browsing and lookups easier and to ensure overall citation integrity and persistence. For example, there are over 25 million web links in the citations in Refcat and we were able to match ~14 million of these to archived web pages in <a href="http://web.archive.org/">Wayback Machine</a> and also found that ~18% of these matched web citations are no longer available on the live web. Web links in citations not in Wayback Machine have been added to ongoing web harvests. We also matched over 20 million citations to books that are available for lending in our <a href="https://openlibrary.org/">Open Library</a> service and matched over 1 million citations to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page">Wikipedia</a> entries. </p>



<p>Besides interconnection, Refcat will allow users to understand what works have cited a specific scholarly resource (i.e. “cited by” or “inbound citations”) that will help with improved discovery features. Finally, knowing the full “knowledge graph” of IA Scholar helps us better identify important scholarly material that we have not yet archived, thus improving the overall quality and extent of the collection. This, in turn, aids scholars by ensuring their open-access work is archived and accessible forever, especially for those whose publisher may not have the resources for long-term preservation, and it ensures that related outputs like research registrations or datasets are also archived, matched to the article of record, and available into the future.</p>



<p>The Refcat release is a milestone of Phase Two of our project, “Ensuring the Persistent Access of Long Tail Open Access Journal Literature,” <a href="http://blog.archive.org/2018/03/05/andrew-w-mellon-foundation-awards-grant-to-the-internet-archive-for-long-tail-journal-preservation/">first announced in 2018</a> and supported by funding from the <a href="https://mellon.org/grants/grants-database/grants/internet-archive/1910-07256/">Andrew W. Mellon Foundation</a>. Current work focuses on citation integrity within the IA Scholar archive, partnerships and services, such as our role in the multi-institutional <a href="https://doaj.org/preservation/">Project Jasper</a> and our partnership with <a href="http://blog.archive.org/2019/09/24/internet-archive-and-center-for-open-science-collaborate-to-preserve-open-science-data/">Center for Open Science</a>, and the addition of secondary scholarly outputs to IA Scholar, including datasets, software, and other non-article/book scholarly materials. Lookout for a plethora of announcements about other IA Scholar milestones in the coming months!</p>

<p><a href="https://communitywebs.archive-it.org/index.html">Community Webs</a>, the Internet Archive’s community history web and digital archiving program, is welcoming over 60 new members from across the US, Canada, and internationally. This new cohort is the first expansion of the Community Webs program outside of the United States and we are thrilled to be supporting the development of diverse, community-based web collections on an international scale.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Community Webs empowers cultural heritage organizations to collaborate with their communities to build web and digital archives of primary sources documenting local history and culture, especially collections inclusive of voices typically underrepresented in traditional memory collections. The program achieves this mission by providing its members with free access to the <a href="https://archive-it.org/">Archive-It</a> web archiving service, digital preservation and digitization services, and technical support and training in topics such as web archiving, community outreach, and digital preservation. The program also offers resources to support a local history archiving community of practice and to facilitate scholarly research.</p>



<p>New Community Webs member Karen Ng, Archivist at Sḵwx̱wú7mesh Úxwumixw (Squamish Nation), BC, Canada, notes that the program offers a way to capture community-generated online content in a context where many of the Nation’s records are held by other institutions. &#8220;The Squamish Nation community is active in creating and documenting language, traditional knowledge, and histories. Now more than ever in the digital age, it is imperative that these stories and histories be captured and stored in accessible ways for future generations.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Similarly, for Maryna Chernyavska, Archivist at the Kule Folklore Centre in Edmonton, Canada, the program will allow the Centre to continue building relationships with community members and organizations. “Being able to assist local heritage organizations with web archiving will help us empower these communities to preserve their heritage based on their values and priorities, but also according to professional standards.”</p>



<p>The current expansion of the program was made possible in part by <a href="https://blog.archive.org/2020/12/08/community-webs-program-receives-1130000-andrew-w-mellon-foundation-award-for-a-national-network-of-public-libraries-building-local-history-web-archives/">generous funding from the Andrew Mellon Foundation</a>, which supports the growth of Community Webs to new public libraries in the US. Additional funding provided by the Internet Archive allows the program to reach cultural heritage organizations in Canada and beyond. This newest cohort brings the total number of participants in Community Webs to over 150 organizations, a ten-fold increase since the program’s inception in 2017. For a full list of new participants, see below. The program continues to add members &#8211; if your institution is interested in joining, please view our open <a href="https://communitywebs.archive-it.org/about.html">calls for applications</a> and please make your favorite local memory organization aware of the opportunity.</p>



<p>Programming for the new cohort is underway and these members are already diving into the program’s educational resources and familiarizing themselves with the technical aspects of web archiving and digital preservation. We kicked things off recently with introductory Zoom sessions, where participants met one another and shared their organizations’ missions, communities served and goals for membership in the program.<a href="https://canvas.instructure.com/enroll/GMD9G6"> Online training modules</a>, developed by staff at the Internet Archive and the <a href="https://educopia.org/">Educopia Institute</a>, went live for new members at the beginning of September. And our new cohort joined our existing Community Webs partners at our virtual <a href="https://archive-it.org/blog/fall-2021-community-webs-virtual-partner-meeting/">Partner Meeting</a> on September 22nd.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We are thrilled to see the program continuing to grow and we look forward to working with our newest cohort. A warm welcome to the following new Community Webs members!</p>

<p>The Internet Archive Hero Award is an annual award that recognizes those who have exhibited leadership in making information available for digital learners all over the world. Previous recipients have included librarian and professor of law <a href="http://blog.archive.org/2020/10/20/michelle-wu-receives-internet-archive-hero-award-for-establishing-the-legal-basis-for-controlled-digital-lending/">Michelle Wu</a>, <a href="https://blog.archive.org/2019/10/23/unlocking-the-potential-for-every-high-school-library-2019-internet-archive-hero-award/">Phillips Academy</a>, the <a href="https://blog.biodiversitylibrary.org/2015/11/bhl-receives-internet-archives-internet.html">Biodiversity Heritage Library</a>, and the <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/grateful-dead-win-internet-hero-award-for-viral-marketing/">Grateful Dead</a>.</p>



<p>This year, we were looking for libraries and librarians who rose to the challenge—this was the year that libraries and librarians have been needed like never before. We wanted to acknowledge the hard work of people who went above and beyond to meet the needs of their communities.</p>



<p>Kanta and Lisa both exemplify the spirit of an Internet Archive Hero:</p>



<ul><li>They helped both of their organizations become early adopters of Controlled Digital Lending in 2019. Of course no one knew it at the time, but that early move helped their patrons stay connected to resources throughout library closures of 2020 and 2021 by already having tens of thousands of digitized books available through each library’s participation in the Internet Archive’s <a href="http://openlibraries.online/">Open Libraries</a> program.</li><li>They donated collections to the Internet Archive that no longer fit their library’s local collection development priorities, so that we could preserve and digitize the books, and make them available to digital learners everywhere.&nbsp;You can learn more about the <a href="http://blog.archive.org/2021/05/26/behind-the-curtain-of-the-hamilton-public-library-theater-book-donation/">theater books donated from Hamilton Public Library</a> and the <a href="http://blog.archive.org/2021/03/10/milton-public-library-reaches-patrons-through-controlled-digital-lending/">30,000 books donated by Milton Public Library</a>.</li><li>They were resources to their professional networks, acting as a point of reference for other librarians interested in learning more about Controlled Digital Lending.</li><li>They thought broadly about access to collections, considering not only, “What helps my local community?” but also, “What helps the global community?”</li></ul>



<p>In addition to their shared achievements, they also brought their individual strengths to their work:</p>



<p>Kanta’s persistent, steady, and polite pushes—whether about donations logistics, joining Open Libraries, or offering suggestions to expand the program—are what it takes to make things happen. Kanta’s gracious and humble nature belie her steely resolve and approach to program advancement: Kanta just kept at it, politely, until she got the results that she thought was right for her library and her community.</p>



<p>Lisa has joined discussions about Controlled Digital Lending since 2019, participating in several panel presentations for librarians and even participating in discussions with US lawmakers and policy experts alongside ALA Annual in Washington, D.C. Lisa’s professionalism and thoughtfulness helped librarians new to the practice of Controlled Digital Lending understand how their library could benefit.</p>



<h2>Celebrate</h2>



<p>Join with us in celebrating Kanta and Lisa at next week&#8217;s Library Leaders Forum. <a href="https://us02web.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_lkvG3xPwT_60QEpT8OcBMg">Registration</a> is free for the virtual event.</p>



<p><strong>Library Leaders Forum</strong><br>October 20 @ 10am PT / 1pm ET &#8211; <a href="https://us02web.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_lkvG3xPwT_60QEpT8OcBMg">Register now</a></p>

<p>Let’s welcome <a href="https://twitter.com/EseoheOjo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Eseohe “Ese” Ojo</a> to the Decentralized Web community! We’re thrilled to have Ese (pronounced “essay”, she/her) as the new DWeb Projects Organizer. She will be working to foster dialogue and build networks among those building a web that is more private, reliable, secure and open. She will also help steward the <a href="https://getdweb.net" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DWeb website</a> as a resource hub for readings, guides, and events related to the Decentralized Web.</p>



<p>We did a short interview with Ese, where we asked her about her professional background, her thoughts on the connections between digital rights, human rights, and the environment, as well as what it is about the DWeb space that brings her hope.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Mai: Can you first tell us about your professional background and what you’ve been working on more recently?</strong></p>



<p>Ese: I have a bachelor’s degree in International Relations and in May 2020, graduated with a master’s degree in Public Policy and Global Affairs as an African Leader of Tomorrow Scholar from the University of British Columbia. During my undergraduate studies in Nigeria, I took a combination of Law and International Relations courses and developed an interest in human rights and international law. I began working in the non-profit sector after graduation on a range of issues including digital rights, freedom of expression, access to information, academic freedom, gender, democracy, good governance and open government.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Most recently, I have worked on the <a href="https://democracy.arts.ubc.ca/2020/11/14/covid-19/">Democratic Health Communications during COVID-19</a>, the <a href="https://www.cigionline.org/activities/global-platform-governance-network/">Global Platform Governance Network at the Centre for International Governance Innovation</a> (CIGI), the <a href="https://www.everydayadvocates.ca/">Every Day Advocates</a> and <a href="https://www.100debates.ca/">100 Debates</a> at GreenPAC before joining the DWeb team.</p>



<p><strong>Mai: Given your background in human rights and digital policy, as well as with your current work in climate organizing, how do you think these issues are intersected</strong>?</p>



<p>Ese: I think these are all interconnected. I began working on environmental issues having worked on other human rights issues previously because I realised and agreed with the <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Environment/SREnvironment/Pages/AboutHRandEnvironment.aspx#:~:text=About%20human%20rights%20and%20the%20environment&amp;text=A%20safe%2C%20clean%2C%20healthy%20and,unable%20to%20fulfil%20our%20aspirations.">assertion</a> that a safe, clean, healthy and sustainable environment is integral to the full enjoyment of other fundamental rights and freedoms.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When it comes to digital rights and right now, as I’m learning more about the decentralised web, I see a lot of parallels. I believe that the original vision for the web and the vision for the decentralized web is meant to be inclusive, private, reliable, secure, and open. It is often said and <a href="https://www.osce.org/fom/250656">reaffirmed</a> that “the same rights that people have offline must also be protected online.”&nbsp; Achieving all of this requires that special attention is paid to what harms we see offline are being reproduced online and even beyond this, what new ones are being created by these spaces. We can only achieve this if everyone in the community is committed to doing their part in small and big ways to create, protect, and defend the world and the web we want.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Mai: What aspects of the decentralized web bring you hope? Are there specific projects or examples that come to mind that demonstrate to you how decentralized technologies can better secure our human rights both online and offline?</strong></p>



<p>The potential for peer-to-peer relationships and control by many rather than a select few holds a lot of promise. I am hopeful that this will bring about alternative solutions to the problems we face now and mean greater, more meaningful access for many. I also hope that this community can learn from the mistakes already made as we work together to build something better — not just in comparison to what already exists but looking beyond to fill some of the gaps too. I am still exploring projects and examples of decentralized technologies and look forward to learning more about them.</p>



<p><strong>Mai: Let me ask you a final, less serious question then! What do you like to do for fun, online and offline?</strong></p>



<p>If my head isn’t buried in a book, I can typically be found rewatching Downton Abbey or Pride and Prejudice. On a rare sunny Vancouver day, I enjoy soaking up some sun at the beach, park, or sea wall.</p>
